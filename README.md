# Data-Extraction-and-NLP
Data Extraction and NLP for Blackcoffer
# Objective
Objective of this document is to explain methodology adopted to perform text analysis to drive sentimental opinion, sentiment scores, readability, passive words, personal pronouns and etc.
# Summary
The project involves extracting textual data from a set of URLs provided in an input Excel file and performing text analysis to compute various variables. The objective is to extract article text from the URLs, clean the text, and analyze it to calculate sentiment scores, readability metrics, and other textual variables.

Here's an overview of the key components and steps involved:

1. Data Extraction: Python code is developed to extract article text from the URLs provided in the input Excel file. Libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup are used for web scraping. The extracted text is cleaned to remove unnecessary elements such as HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.

2. Text Analysis: The cleaned text is subjected to text analysis to compute various variables. This includes sentiment analysis to determine positive and negative scores, polarity score, and subjectivity score using the TextBlob library. Readability metrics such as average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog index are calculated. Additionally, the count of personal pronouns and the average word length are computed.

3. Output Generation: The computed variables are structured according to the required output format specified in an output Excel file. The output includes URL IDs, URLs, sentiment scores, readability metrics, and other textual variables.

4. Code Implementation: Python code is developed to automate the entire process. Libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) are utilized for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and syllable counting. The output is generated as a new Excel file containing the computed variables.

Overall, the project involves a combination of web scraping, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and readability analysis techniques to extract and analyze textual data from URLs and generate structured output for further analysis or reporting. The code is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy adaptation to different sets of URLs and analytical requirements.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the assignment successfully achieved its objective of extracting textual data from provided URLs and conducting comprehensive text analysis to compute various variables. The project demonstrated proficiency in web scraping techniques using libraries such as requests and BeautifulSoup to extract article text from websites.

Furthermore, the implementation of text analysis involved preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal using the NLTK library. Sentiment analysis using TextBlob provided insights into the sentiment polarity and subjectivity of the extracted text. Additionally, readability metrics such as average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog index were calculated to assess the readability of the text.

The assignment showcased the ability to automate the entire process through Python programming, ensuring efficiency and scalability for analyzing large datasets. The generated output, structured according to the specified format, provides valuable insights into the textual content of the articles, facilitating further analysis or decision-making processes.

Overall, the assignment demonstrated proficiency in web scraping, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and readability analysis, showcasing the capability to extract meaningful information from textual data sourced from the web. The project underscores the importance of leveraging programming and computational techniques to derive insights from unstructured data sources, contributing to informed decision-making and data-driven strategies.
